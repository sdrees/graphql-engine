metadata is not consistent: the aggregate expression Int4_aggregate_exp (in subgraph default) specifies an aggregation function '_top5' which is mapped to the data connector 'mypg (in subgraph default)' but the Open DD return type [Int4] (in subgraph default) is not compatible with the data connector's return type. Reason: The data connector's return type is the named type 'int4', but the Open DD return type is an array
