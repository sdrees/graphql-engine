# Hasura CLI: connector status

Print the current status of the custom Hasura Data Connector deployment.

## Synopsis

Print the status of the custom Hasura Data Connector deployment. Will also print the logs, if they are available, of the image build from the source code from the GitHub repository. 
		
Once the connector is live, you can use the endpoint in a Hasura Cloud project. To do so, the endpoint needs to be added to the metadata, this can be done by following these steps: https://hasura.io/docs/latest/databases/data-connectors/#adding-hasura-graphql-data-connector-agent-to-metadata.
