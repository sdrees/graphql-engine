# Metrics via Prometheus

<ProductBadge self />

## Enable metrics endpoint

By default the Prometheus metrics endpoint is disabled. To enable Prometheus metrics, configure the environment variable
below:

```bash
HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLED_APIS=metadata,graphql,config,metrics
```

Secure the Prometheus metrics endpoint with a secret:

```bash
HASURA_GRAPHQL_METRICS_SECRET=<secret>
```

```bash
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/metrics' -H 'Authorization: Bearer <secret>'
```

:::info Configure a secret

The metrics endpoint should be configured with a secret to prevent misuse and should not be exposed over the internet.

## Metrics exported

The following metrics are exported by Hasura GraphQL Engine:

### Hasura active subscription pollers

Current number of active subscription pollers. A subscription poller
[multiplexes](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/blob/master/architecture/live-queries.md#idea-3-batch-multiple-live-queries-into-one-sql-query)
similar subscriptions together. The value of this metric should be proportional to the number of uniquely parameterized
subscriptions (i.e., subscriptions with the same selection set, but with different input arguments and session variables
are multiplexed on the same poller). If this metric is high then it may be an indication that there are too many
uniquely parameterized subscriptions which could be optimized for better performance.

|        |                                              |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Name   | `hasura_active_subscription_pollers`         |
| Type   | Gauge                                        |
| Labels | `subscription_kind`: streaming \| live-query |

### Hasura active subscription pollers in error state

Current number of active subscription pollers that are in the error state. A subscription poller
[multiplexes](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/blob/master/architecture/live-queries.md#idea-3-batch-multiple-live-queries-into-one-sql-query)
similar subscriptions together. A non-zero value of this metric indicates that there are runtime errors in atleast one
of the subscription pollers that are running in Hasura. In most of the cases, runtime errors in subscriptions are caused
due to the changes at the data model layer and fixing the issue at the data model layer should automatically fix the
runtime errors.

|        |                                                     |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Name   | `hasura_active_subscription_pollers_in_error_state` |
| Type   | Gauge                                               |
| Labels | `subscription_kind`: streaming \| live-query        |

### Hasura active subscriptions

Current number of active subscriptions, representing the subscription load on the server.

|        |                               |
| ------ | ----------------------------- |
| Name   | `hasura_active_subscriptions` |
| Type   | Gauge                         |
| Labels | none                          |

### Hasura cron events invocation total

Total number of cron events invoked, representing the number of invocations made for cron events.

|        |                                       |
| ------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Name   | `hasura_cron_events_invocation_total` |
| Type   | Counter                               |
| Labels | `status`: success \| failed           |

### Hasura cron events processed total

Total number of cron events processed, representing the number of invocations made for cron events. Compare this to
`hasura_cron_events_invocation_total`. A high difference between the two metrics indicates high failure rate of the cron
webhook.

|        |                                      |
| ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Name   | `hasura_cron_events_processed_total` |
| Type   | Counter                              |
| Labels | `status`: success \| failed          |

### Hasura event fetch time per batch

Latency of fetching a batch of events. A higher metric indicates slower polling of events from the database, you should
consider looking into the performance of your database.

|        |                                                                                            |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Name   | `hasura_event_fetch_time_per_batch_seconds`                                                |
| Type   | Histogram<br /><br />Buckets: 0.0001, 0.0003, 0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 |
| Labels | none                                                                                       |

### Hasura event invocations total

Total number of events invoked. Represents the Event Trigger webhook HTTP requests made.

|        |                                  |
| ------ | -------------------------------- |
| Name   | `hasura_event_invocations_total` |
| Type   | Counter                          |
| Labels | `status`: success \| failed      |

### Hasura event processed total

Total number of events processed. Represents the Event Trigger egress.

|        |                                |
| ------ | ------------------------------ |
| Name   | `hasura_event_processed_total` |
| Type   | Counter                        |
| Labels | `status`: success \| failed    |

### Hasura event processing time

The time taken for an event to be delivered since it's been created (if first attempt) or retried (after first attempt).
This metric can be considered as the end-to-end processing time for an event.

|        |                                                                       |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name   | `hasura_event_processing_time_seconds`                                |
| Type   | Histogram<br /><br />Buckets: 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100 |
| Labels | none                                                                  |

### Hasura event queue time

Queue time for an event already in the processing queue. More events in a higher bucket implies slow processing. In this
case, you can consider increasing the
[HTTP pool size](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx/#events-http-pool-size) or optimizing the webhook
server.

|        |                                                                       |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name   | `hasura_event_queue_time_seconds`                                     |
| Type   | Histogram<br /><br />Buckets: 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100 |
| Labels | none                                                                  |

### Hasura event trigger HTTP workers

Current number of active Event Trigger HTTP workers. Compare this number to the
[HTTP pool size](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx/#events-http-pool-size). Consider increasing it if the
metric is near the current configured value.

|        |                                     |
| ------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Name   | `hasura_event_trigger_http_workers` |
| Type   | Gauge                               |
| Labels | none                                |

### Hasura event webhook processing time

The time between when an HTTP worker picks an event for delivery to the time its response is updated in the DB. A higher
processing time indicates slow webhook, you should try to optimize the event webhook.

|        |                                                              |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Name   | `hasura_event_webhook_processing_time_seconds`               |
| Type   | Histogram<br /><br />Buckets: 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 |
| Labels | none                                                         |

### Hasura GraphQL execution time seconds

Execution time of successful GraphQL requests (excluding subscriptions). If more requests are falling in the higher
buckets, you should consider [tuning the performance](/deployment/performance-tuning.mdx).

|        |                                                                |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name   | `hasura_graphql_execution_time_seconds`                        |
| Type   | Histogram<br /><br />Buckets: 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10   |
| Labels | `operation_type`: query \| mutation \| subscription \| unknown |

### Hasura GraphQL requests total

Number of GraphQL requests received, representing the GraphQL query/mutation traffic on the server.

|        |                                                                |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name   | `hasura_graphql_requests_total`                                |
| Type   | Counter                                                        |
| Labels | `operation_type`: query \| mutation \| subscription \| unknown |

The `unknown` operation type will be returned for queries that fail authorization, parsing, or certain validations. The
`response_status` label will be `success` for successful requests and `failed` for failed requests.

### Hasura HTTP connections

Current number of active HTTP connections (excluding WebSocket connections), representing the HTTP load on the server.

|        |                           |

| Type   | Gauge                     |
| Labels | none                      |

### Hasura one-off events invocation total

Total number of one-off events invoked, representing the number of invocations made for one-off events.

|        |                                         |

| Labels | `status`: success \| failed             |

### Hasura one-off events processed total

Total number of one-off events processed, representing the number of invocations made for one-off events. Compare this
to `hasura_oneoff_events_invocation_total`. A high difference between the two metrics indicates high failure rate of the
one-off webhook.

|        |                                        |
| ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Name   | `hasura_oneoff_events_processed_total` |
| Type   | Counter                                |
| Labels | `status`: success \| failed            |

### Hasura postgres connections

Current number of active PostgreSQL connections. Compare this to
[pool settings](/api-reference/syntax-defs.mdx/#pgpoolsettings).

|        |                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name   | `hasura_postgres_connections`                                                                                                                                                     |

| Labels | `source_name`: name of the database<br />`conn_info`: connection url string (password omitted) or name of the connection url environment variable<br />`role`: primary \| replica |

### Hasura WebSocket connections

Current number of active WebSocket connections, representing the WebSocket load on the server.

|        |                                |
| ------ | ------------------------------ |
| Name   | `hasura_websocket_connections` |
| Type   | Gauge                          |
| Labels | none                           |

:::info GraphQL request execution time

- Uses wall-clock time, so it includes time spent waiting on I/O.
- Includes authorization, parsing, validation, planning, and execution (calls to databases, Remote Schemas).
