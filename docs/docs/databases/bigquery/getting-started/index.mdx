# Get Started with BigQuery

To try Hasura with BigQuery, you'll need your own new or existing BigQuery database.

Here are two ways you can get started with Hasura:

1.  [Hasura Cloud](/databases/bigquery/getting-started/cloud.mdx): Access and manage your BigQuery
database from Hasura Cloud.
2.  [Docker](/databases/bigquery/getting-started/docker.mdx): Run Hasura with Docker and then connect your BigQuery
database to Hasura.
