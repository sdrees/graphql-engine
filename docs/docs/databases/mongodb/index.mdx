:::tip Supported features

Hasura currently supports queries, table relationships, remote relationships and permissions on MongoDB databases.

A [logical model](/schema/mongodb/logical-models.mdx) or database [validation schema](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/upcoming/core/schema-validation/specify-json-schema/#std-label-schema-validation-json) is required for generating your GraphQL schema.
