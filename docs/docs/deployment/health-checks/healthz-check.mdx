# Healthz Check

Hasura provides a Health Check endpoint to monitor the status of the GraphQL API. This is available under the
`/healthz` endpoint for all Hasura Projects (including the OSS GraphQL Engine).

Make a `GET` request to the `/healthz` endpoint to fetch the status:

```bash
curl -XGET https://advanced-hasura.hasura.app/healthz
```

Replace `advanced-hasura` with your project name.

The status could be one of the following:

- `200, OK` - This requires no action. Everything is working as expected.
- `200, WARN, inconsistent objects in schema` - This requires a review of Metadata since some inconsistent objects have
  been identified. Usually occurs when there is a `metadata apply` that had the wrong objects.
- `500, ERROR` - This means the API is not working and the [logs](/deployment/logging.mdx#health-check-log-structure)
  need to be checked.
