# GraphQL Engine Server Configuration

## Introduction

Hasura supports various flags/env vars for customizing how you are
running the GraphQL Engine in your environment.

## Server config

See the [server config reference](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx) for all the
available flags/env vars.

## Use cases

The following are a few configuration use cases:

- [Add an admin secret](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/config-examples.mdx#add-admin-secret)
- [Using CLI commands with admin secret](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/config-examples.mdx#cli-with-admin-secret)
- [Configure CORS](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/config-examples.mdx#configure-cors)
- [Run the Console offline (i.e load Console assets from server instead of CDN)](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/config-examples.mdx#console-assets-on-server)
- [Dev (debugging) mode](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/config-examples.mdx#dev-mode)
