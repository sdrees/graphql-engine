# Event Trigger Performance Tuning

Event Trigger processing can be tuned by few server settings as described below.

## Events fetch batch size

The "events fetch batch size" setting which defaults to 100 and is the maximum number of database events that can be
fetched in a single batch.

See the [Hasura Engine flags documentation](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx#events-fetch-batch-size) for
more information on events fetch batch size.

## Events HTTP pool size

The "events HTTP pool size" sets the maximum number of concurrent HTTP workers for event delivery. Its value is an
integer and defaults to 100.

See the [Hasura Engine flags documentation](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx#events-http-pool-size) for
more information on events HTTP pool size.

## Events fetch interval

The "events fetch interval" is the interval time, in milliseconds, to sleep before trying to fetch events again after a
fetch returned no events from the database.

See the [Hasura Engine flags documentation](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx#events-fetch-interval) for
more information on events fetch interval.
