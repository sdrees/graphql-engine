### Send a request for a product review

In e-commerce applications, it's common to send a request for a product review a certain period of time after the
product has been delivered. This is great for improving trust on an e-commerce site, increasing SEO, and encouraging customers to return. This recipe shows how to send a request for a product review 7 days after the product is
delivered. However, understanding the principles of this example will help you to implement your own custom logic for
triggering any event which is based on a time interval. [Check it out](/scheduled-triggers/recipes/product-review.mdx)!
